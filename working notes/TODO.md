- Add "Play Again" Button for replaying quiz again--needs to bring user back to homepage. How do I make it go back to the main frame? Need multiple frames or a mainpage function?
- Figure out the second GUI way for user to input the questions and answers and have them saved into a file: save and load the data of the class into a file
- Figure out how to add text entry field to load whatever .txt file full of questions for the app. It it is hardcoded right now to questions.txt.
- Make everything allign with Classes

Mabye for version 2?
- Version 2: Have a countdown timer function...Base points off of how fast you answer?
- Option to randomize question order presented?
- Add a gaming element for engagement/visual appeal
- Allow users to type in their responses instead of multiple choice hitting pre-selected button answers?
- Fill out instructions message box
- Allow users to select their questions.txt file in a file selector for the program to read?
